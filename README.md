# Regression-model-to-estimate-prices-of-real-estate-properties-in-Melbourne
Developing a regression model in python to estimate/predict the prices of real estate properties in Melbourne based on paraters like proximity to hospitals, supermarkets, railway stations etc

•	Developed a model that could estimate property prices based on factors such as proximity to supermarkets, hospitals, train and bus stops, time taken to reach flinders street(city) etc.

•	To facilitate this, I had developed a script that could join multiple datasets consisting of the location co-ordinates of the above factors. A customized algorithm was created to calculate the shortest distance to each factor.  

•	Significant wrangling was also performed to find time taken to reach the city using the PTV Schedule.

•	Linear regression was used to analyse the impact(weight) of these factors as well as estimate the price of a new property.

The files consist of xml, json, txt and shape files
